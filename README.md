# Neighborhood Map Project

The map connects to beermapping.com's api to supply a list of bars and breweries in the greater Indianapolis area. The website may need to get the word out in order to have a more complete list but the data they have is working.

To start using the map open the map.html file.

##Using the Map

The map prepopulates the locations found by beermapping.com. Clicking on the markers populated will give the name, address and url for that location.

There is a corresponding listing to the left that is filterable. To see the list click on the flower and click the flower again to remove it. Each item in the list is clickable and will populate the same information that clicking on the marker does.

The search bar allows for filtering the list of known locations This will work whether the list is showing or not. If while filtering you want to see the list clicking the flower will populate the filtered list.

It should be noted that the filter section is case sensitive. For example, typing "C" will give you results for locations starting with "C" or that have a second word beginning with "C". On the other hand typing "c" will give you any name in the list that conatins a lower case "c". In this situation it will exclude the locations beginning with "C" unless there is another "c" in the name.
